# Security

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.

🔐 Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue or vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, report it privately:

Open a GitHub issue with minimal detail and ask to discuss privately.

Or create a temporary GitHub account to report anonymously.

This project is currently under development and not intended for production use, but I still appreciate reports that could improve its safety.
